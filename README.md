# Exploring Relationships with New Taipei City Real Estate Data Set

Welcome to my repository for exploring relationships within the New Taipei City real estate dataset. This repository contains a script for conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizing various relationships present in the dataset.

## Introduction

In this project, I've analyzed and visualized the relationships between different variables in the New Taipei City real estate dataset. The script provided conducts data cleaning, explores correlations, creates scatterplots, pair plots, and categorical plots to gain insights into the factors influencing house prices in New Taipei City.

## Script

The script file `Exploring Relationships - Raul Brand.ipynb`is attached on the repository and contains Python code to perform the following tasks:

- Importing visualization libraries and the dataset
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploring relationships between variables
- Visualizing correlations, scatterplots, pair plots, and categorical plots

## Usage

To use the script:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the "Scripts" directory.
3. Run the `Exploring Relationships - Raul Brand.ipynb` file in your preferred Python environment.

## Dataset

The New Taipei City real estate dataset used in this project can be found on the repository as well.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Visualizations

The repository includes visualizations generated from the analysis. You can find these visualizations in the "Visualizations" directory.
